# Ceramic Data Model Explorer

For the [Ceramic Network](https://ceramic.network/) task **Create A System For Discovery And/Or Curation Of DataModels** in the [Gitcoin Hackathon](https://gitcoin.co/issue/ceramicnetwork/ceramic/82/100026725).

## Features To Implement

* Upvote/downvote data models and schemas
* List of top rated data models
* List applications currently using a given data model package
* List data models by network usage popularity (package installs or streams created using the model)
* Search or explore existing data models based on key words, categories, application use cases, etc.
* An ability for developers to propose a change to an existing data model
* A way for community members to vote and/or discuss the proposed change

If there is consensus and the proposal is accepted, the system would ideally provide a way to get the original creator/owner to accept the change and update the data model by updating its associated Ceramic streams.
